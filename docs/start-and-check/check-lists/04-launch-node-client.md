# How to launch the node client?

You can launch the node client building it:

1. From Docker image. Use [this](../build-and-start-a-node/05-startingTpNode_docker.md#starting-the-node) guide.
2. From source code. Use [this](../build-and-start-a-node/06-startingTpNode_source.md#starting-the-node) guide.
3. Using `docker-commpose`. Use [this](../build-and-start-a-node/07-startingTpNode_docker_compose.md) guide. **This option is the recommended way of building and starting the node.**
