# Release Notes

Hey Powerians!

Thank you for supporting Power DCloud and participating in the testnet campaign.

We have two great news:

1. The Rover bot already started to monitor testnet nodes. It checks status every 10 min. If the node is online and synced, you will get points that will be converted to SK tokens.

2. We released the Power Node v.0.13.11.

What's new:
   - Added API endpoints for node monitoring and forced sync launching.
   - These changes help with network monitoring and support node owners in the next stages.
   - Added detailed info about peer streams.
   - Added the ability to get block hash by block number

Please update your nodes.

> WARNING
> 
> Please be careful with the `node.config` and `genesis.txt`, as well as the `db` directory.
