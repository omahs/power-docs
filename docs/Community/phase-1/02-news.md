Hey, Powerians!

We are glad to announce, that we've successfully run the first chain of our testnet, yoo-hoo!

You can now monitor the chain status, as well as get information about all the nodes in the chain [here](https://zabbix.thepower.io/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view)

During the launch we've worked in close cooperation with our Superpower-community, which fully consists of true crypto-enthusiasts.

Thank you for your help and great cooperation ability, our dear Powerians!

## 01/11/2022: Monitoring, tokens, Power Node version updated

Hey, Powerians!

Thank you for supporting Power DCloud and participating in the testnet campaign.

**We have two great news:**

1. The Rover bot already started to monitor testnet nodes. It checks status every 10 min. If the node is online and synced, you will get points that will be converted to SK tokens.

2. We released the Power Node v.0.13.11.

   **What's new:**
      - Added API endpoints for node monitoring and forced sync launching.
      - These changes help with network monitoring and support node owners in the next stages.
      - Added detailed info about peer streams.
      - Added the ability to get block hash by block number.

## Power node version update

Please, update your node according to the manual below.
