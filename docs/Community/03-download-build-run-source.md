## Introduction

If you want to go through the hardcore way of building sources, this manual will help you do this.

## Step 1: Set up the working environment

You can install Erlang either using the package manager, or using `kerl`.

### Install Erlang using the package manager

If you use the recommended Ubuntu version (22.04.1), you can install Erlang using the package manager. To do this, run the following command:

   ```bash
   apt install cmake clang gcc git curl libssl-dev build-essential automake autoconf libncurses5-dev elixir erlang
   ```

If you use other version of Ubuntu (20.04, for instance), refer to the section below to install Erlang using `kerl`.

### Install Erlang using `kerl`

To install erlang using `kerl`:

1. Install the software you need to seamlessly install Erlang:

   ```bash
   apt install cmake clang gcc git curl libssl-dev build-essential automake autoconf libncurses5-dev elixir erlang-base erlang-public-key erlang-asn1 erlang-ssl erlang-dev erlang-inets erlang-eunit
   ```

2. Create a directory, where Erlang will be installed to:

   ```bash
   mkdir /opt/erlang
   ```

3. Create a directory, where you will work with your node:

   ```bash
   mkdir /opt/<your_node>
   ```

4. Go to `/opt/erlang` directory:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/erlang
   ```

5. Install Erlang. To do this, download the `kerl` script:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerl/kerl/master/kerl
   ```

   > **Hint**
   >
   > If you already have Erlang installed on your machine, we strongly recommend deleting it before the new installation, using the following command:
   >
   > ```bash
   > apt purge erlang*
   > ```

6. Change script mode to executable by using the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod a+x kerl
   ```

7. Update the list of Erlang releases using the following command:

    ```bash
    ./kerl update releases
    ```

8. Build the release 24.3 using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./kerl build 24.3
   ```

   After installation is complete, you will see the following message in the console:

    ```text
    Erlang/OTP 24.3 (24.3) has been successfully built
    ```
9. Create a new subdirectory in `erlang`:

   ```bash
   mkdir /opt/erlang/<your_directory_name>
   ```
10. Install Erlang to the subdirectory you've created on step 10 using the following command:

    ```bash
    ./kerl install 24.3 /opt/erlang/<your_directory_name>
    ```

11. Run the following command to activate the Erlang installation:

    ```bash
    source /opt/erlang/<your_directory_name>/activate
    ```

> **Note:**
>
> If your Erlang installation is not activated, you will NOT be able to build the node.

After setting up the working environment, you can download and build the node.

## Step 2: Download and build the node

> **Note**
>
> Choose a project folder to clone your project into. Use this folder to build the node.

1. Download the node sources from Github into your working directory (`your_node`, for instance), using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thepower/tpnode.git -b e24
    ```

2. Go to `tpnode` directory, using the command:

   ```bash
   cd tpnode
   ```

3. Check and download the dependencies using the command:

   ```bash
   ./rebar3 get-deps
   ```

4. Compile the node source by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./rebar3 compile
   ```

5. Build the release by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ./rebar3 release
   ```

6. Copy the node directory from `_build/default/rel/thepower` to `/opt` by running the following command:

   ```bash
   cp -r _build/default/rel/thepower /opt
   ```

## ## Step 3: Get Tea Ceremony client and token

1. Get the Tea Ceremony client by running the following command:

   ```bash
   wget https://tea.thepower.io/teaclient
   ```

2. Change the `teaclient` file mode to executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x teaclient
   ```

   Otherwise, you will NOT be able to start the client. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more details.

3. Get the Tea Ceremony token from the testnet administrators.

   > **Note**
   >
   > This and the following steps are crucial because you will NOT be able to start your node without `genesis.txt` and `node.config` files. You can find more information about these files [here](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/tpNodeConfiguration).

## Step 4: Start the Tea Ceremony client

[Start the Tea Ceremony client](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/get-and-start-tea-ceremony-client/#start-the-tea-ceremony-client) using the token you've got from the testnet administrators.

To start the client, run the following command:

```erlang
./teaclient -n nickname token
```

where

- `teaclient` — Tea Ceremony client,
- `nickname` - The name of your node. Maximum 10 characters.
- `token` — Tea Ceremony Token, you've got from the Tea Ceremony administrators.

After you have started the client, wait for other participants. Please, DON'T turn off the Tea Ceremony client for 24 hours.

> **Note**
>
> If the client is started without options, you will see a short reference on the command and options.

If you have successfully started the Tea Ceremony client, you will get `node.config` and `genesis.txt` files after the ceremony ends. You can find these files under the same directory where you have started the Tea Ceremony client.

> **Attention**
>
> After the tea ceremony ends, you need to edit the `node.config`. To do this, refer to the section below.

## Step 5: Create directories and place the files

> **Hint**
>
> You can create an additional directory named `thepower`, for example, and place `db` and `log` as subdirectories there.

To create directories for files:

1. Go to your working directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   cd /opt/thepower
   ```

2. Create `db` and `log` directories in your working directory (`/opt/thepower`, for instance) using the following command:

   ```bash
   mkdir db
   mkdir log
   ```

3. Place `genesis.txt` and `node.config` near these directories using the following commands:

   ```bash
   mv ~/example_directory/node.config /opt/thepower/node.config
   ```

   ```bash
   mv ~/example_directory/genesis.txt /opt/thepower/genesis.txt
   ```

## Step 6: Edit `node.config`

Edit `node.config` file. See the [example](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/tpNodeConfiguration#nodeconfig-example) in [How to configure TP-Node?](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/tpNodeConfiguration) guide, and then refer to the section below.

### How to edit `node.config`?

Here is the example of a chain consisting of ten nodes:

```erlang
{tpic, #{
    peers => [
        {"powernode01.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode02.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode03.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode04.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode05.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode06.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode07.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode08.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode09.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode10.thepower.io", 41025}
        ],
    port => 41025} }.
{discovery,
    #{
        addresses => [
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 41025, proto => tpic},
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 1080, proto => api},
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 1443, proto => apis}
        ]
    }
}.

{hostname, "<NODE_HOST_NAME>"}.
{dbsuffix,""}.
{loglevel, info}.
{info_log, "log/info.log"}.
{error_log, "log/error.log"}.
{debug_log, "log/debug.log"}.
{rpcsport, 1443}.
{rpcport, 1080}.

{privkey, "<PRIVATE_KEY>"}.
```

Edit the file as follows:

1. Specify the node addresses and port numbers you've received from the bot. You don't need to specify your own node:

   ```erlang
   tpic, #{
    peers => [
        {"powernode01.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode02.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode03.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode04.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode05.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode06.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode07.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode08.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode09.thepower.io", 41025},
        {"powernode10.thepower.io", 41025}
        ],
   ```

2. Check the `allow_rfc1918` parameter to be `false`. If `true`, it allows nodes to work within a local network.
   3.Check the `port` parameter. The value of this parameter should be the same as the port value in `peers`:

   ```erlang
   port => 41025}
   ```

5. Specify your node and port to be used for `tpic`, `api`, and `apis` protocols in `addresses` parameter:

   ```erlang
   addresses => [
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 41025, proto => tpic},
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 1080, proto => api},
            #{address => "<NODE_HOST_NAME>", port => 1443, proto => apis}
        ]
   ```

6. Specify your node address in `hostname` parameter:

   ```erlang
   {hostname, "<NODE_HOST_NAME>"}.
   ```

7. Specify names of your nodes in `dbsuffix` parameter if you want to start multiple nodes on one machine. It creates different DB directories for each node. If you have only one node, `dbsuffix` must be empty:

   ```erlang
   {dbsuffix,""}.
   ```

8. Specify the `.log` files, where the logs for your node will be stored:

   ```erlang
   {loglevel, info}.
   {info_log, "log/info.log"}.
   {error_log, "log/error.log"}.
   {debug_log, "log/debug.log"}.
   ```

9. Specify the ports for `rpc` and `rpcs` protocols:

   ```erlang
   {rpcsport, 1443}.
   {rpcport, 1080}.
   ```

> **Warning**
>
> The private key you get with the `genesis.txt` file cannot be restored, if you lose it. Please, store it securely.

## Step 7: Get the certificate

[Obtain the SSL certificate for your node](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/build-and-start-a-node/ssl-certs-for-node) and place it into the `db` directory.

## And, finally, step 8: Start the node

To start the node from source code:

   ```bash
   ./bin/thepower foreground
   ```

## How to check, if my node works?

To check, if your node works, run:

```bash
curl http://your_node.example.com:00000/api/node/status | jq
```

where:

- `your_node.example.com` — your node address;
- `00000` — port, that your node uses for `api`.

Replace the example parameters with the ones you need.

## What do I need to do if something goes wrong?

> **Attention**
>
> If something goes wrong, go to the `log` folder, and read the logs. If there are errors, write to Power Ecosystem Telegram chat: `https://t.me/thepower_chat`.

### Troubleshooting

1. You get the following error:

    ```bash
    ===> Failed to boot tpnode for reason {{{badmatch,undefined},
    [{nodekey,get_priv,0,
    [{file,
    "/home/thepower/tpnode/apps/tpnode/src/nodekey.erl"},
    {line,26}]},
    {tpic2,certificate,0,
    [{file,
    "/home/thepower/tpnode/apps/tpic2/src/tpic2.erl"},
    {line,196}]},
    {tpic2,
    '-childspec/0-fun-0-',2,
    [{file,
    "/home/thepower/tpnode/apps/tpic2/src/tpic2.erl"},
    {line,217}]},
    {tpic2,childspec,0,
    [{file,
    "/home/thepower/tpnode/apps/tpic2/src/tpic2.erl"},
    {line,229}]},
    {tpnode_sup,init,1,
    [{file,
    "/home/thepower/tpnode/apps/tpnode/src/tpnode_sup.erl"},
    {line,88}]},
    {supervisor,init,1,
    [{file,"supervisor.erl"},
    {line,295}]},
    {gen_server,init_it,2,
    [{file,"gen_server.erl"},
    {line,374}]},
    {gen_server,init_it,6,
    [{file,"gen_server.erl"},
    {line,342}]}]},
    {tpnode,start,[normal,[]]}}
    ```
   **Reason**

   You don't have `genesis.txt` and `node.config` files.

   **Solution**

   Start the Tea Ceremony client **BEFORE** starting the node. It will get proper `genesis.txt` and `node.config`.

2. You get the following error when starting the Tea Ceremony client:

   ```bash
    ~/tpnode# ./teaclient DEE570BD76F3
    -bash: ./teaclient: Permission denied
   ```

   **Reason**

   Probably, you haven't changed `teaclient` file mode to executable.

   **Solution**

   Change `teaclient` file mode to executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x tea*
   ```
3. You get the following error when starting the Tea Ceremony client:

   ```bash
   ~# ./teaclient -n demonode05 DEE570BD76F3
   ceremony client connecting to tea.thepower.io:443
   Server rejects connection, reason: bad_token
   ```

   **Reason**

   Token `DEE570BD76F3` has been used by another user.

   **Solution**

   Get the new token from the chain administrators.

4. You get the following error when starting the Tea Ceremony client:

   ```bash
   ceremony client connecting to knuth.cleverfox.ru:1436
   =WARNING REPORT==== 19-Oct-2022::14:32:54.056133 ===
   Description: "Authenticity is not established by certificate path validation"
   Reason: "Option {verify, verify_peer} and cacertfile/cacerts is missing"

   Server rejects connection, reason: you_are_late
   ```

   **Reason**

   You are late for the tea ceremony.

   **Solution**

   Stick to the bot recommendations and don't be late.
