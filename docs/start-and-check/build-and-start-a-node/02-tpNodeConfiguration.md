## What is `node.config` and `genesis.txt`?

Despite each node having the same software, there are two critical files:

- `genesis.txt` — the chain configuration file. You need this configuration file only when you start up a chain for the first time. When the chain is started up, the zero-block should be created. The zero-block should contain all the necessary settings, as well as the current configuration (which nodes are now present in the chain). To create the zero-block, you need to add the nodes' cryptographic signatures to the data that `genesis.txt` contains. All the nodes in the chain use the same Genesis file.
- `node.config` — the node configuration file. This file is unique for each node. It has two basic settings:

    - The node private key.
    - Networking. Here you tell the node, how should it work with the network and where should it find the information about other nodes in the chain.


## `node.config` example

> **Note**
> 
> `node.config` file has Erlang-formatted syntax.

Here is an example of a `node.config` file:

```erlang
{tpic,#{peers => [{"node2", 43218},{"node3", 43219}], port => 43217, allow_rfc1918 => true}}. 
{hostname, "node1"}. 
{discovery,#{addresses =>[
  #{address => "node1", port => 43217, proto => tpic},
  #{address => "node1", port => 43390, proto => apis},
  #{address => "node1", port => 43290, proto => api}
]}}.
{privkey, <<"670270653FBBBC3AF41EF92CECF120CFB27F3D3C8E2D6032433E60A4016BC692">>}.
{rpcport, 43290}.
{rpcsport, 43390}.
{tpic_port, 43217}.
{dbsuffix,"_node1"}.
{dbpath,"db1"}.
{crosschain, #{ port => 43312, connect => [ {"other_chain_node.example.com", 43312} ] }}.
```

| `tpic`       | Node interconnection protocol. It describes the way the nodes search for each other and connect to each other. For the first connection you need at least one node.                                                                                                                                                    | `"node2"`, `"node3"`, ... — node names<br /> `43218`, `43219` — port to connect to (you can use any port)<br />  `allow_rfc1918` — this options turns off filtering of "grey" IP addresses. It will likely be deprecated under actual operation. |
| `hostname`   | Hostname.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `"node1"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Edit the file, when you get it. Just replace node names, ports and addresses with the ones you need. Check out the "How to edit `node.config`" guide for [Docker](../../testnet/phase-1/02-download-build-run-docker.md) and for built from [sources](../../testnet/phase-1/03-download-build-run-source.md).

## Generation of `genesis.txt`

> **Note**
> 
> Before you start, ensure that you have TPNode installed on your machine.

To generate `genesis.txt`:

1. Ensure you have Erlang installed on your machine.
2. Open Erlang console and run the following command:

   ```erlang
   genesis_easy:make_example(105,10).
   ```

   where:

    - `105` — chain number,
    - `10` — number of nodes in chain.

   `make_example` creates a template file with Genesis parameters.

3. Open the template file.
4. Fill in the Genesis parameters.
5. Create the Genesis file by running the following command:

  ```erlang
  genesis_easy:make_genesis(105).
  ```

where:

- `105` — chain number

After generation, Genesis will be saved into `your_chain_genesis.txt` file:

```erlang

After you have gone through all the steps above, rename Genesis file as `genesis.txt` and copy it to all nodes in the chain.

Also copy the corresponding private keys for each node from file `your_chain_keys.txt` to `node.config`.
