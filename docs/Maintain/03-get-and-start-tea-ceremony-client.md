## Introduction

This guide will help you get and start the Tea Ceremony client. You can find the additional information about the Tea Ceremony algorithm [here](../Explore/technology/10-tea-ceremony.md).

## Set up your environment

> **Note**
>
> To start the Tea ceremony client, ensure you have Erlang installed on your machine.

If you don't have Erlang installed on your machine, follow the steps below:

1.  Download the `kerl` script:

    ```bash
    curl -O [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerl/kerl/master/kerl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerl/kerl/master/kerl)
    ```
    
    > **Note**
    >
    > If you already have Erlang installed on your machine, we strongly recommend deleting it before the new installation, using the following command:
    >
    > ```bash
    > apt purge erlang*
    > ```

2. Change script mode to executable by using the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod a+x kerl
    ```
   
3. Create a new directory in `/opt`. You can choose any name for this directory. Noteworthy is that the name should be descriptive for you:

   ```bash
   mkdir erlang
   ```

4. Update the list of Erlang releases using the following command:

```bash
./kerl update releases
```

5. Build the release 24.3 using the following command:

```bash
./kerl build 24.3
```

After installation is complete, you will see the following message in the console:

```text
Erlang/OTP 24.3 (24.3) has been successfully built
```

6. Install Erlang using the following command:

```bash
./kerl install 24.3 /opt/erlang
```

7. Run the following command to activate the Erlang installation:

```bash
source /opt/erlang/activate
```

## Get the Tea Ceremony client

Open the terminal and run the following command to get the Tea Ceremony client:

```bash
wget https://tea.thepower.io/teaclient
```

## Start the Tea Ceremony client

1. Change `teaclient` file mode to executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x tea*
   ```

2. Run the following command to start the client:

   ```erlang
   ./teaclient 52E616B1B48C
   ```

   where

   - `teaclient` — Tea Ceremony client,
   - `52E616B1B48C` — Tea Ceremony Token, you've got from the bot.

After you have started the client, you can watch the Tea Ceremony process.

> **Note**
>
> If the client is started without options, you will see a short reference on the command and options.

## After the client is started

After the client is started, all the nodes in the chain sign the `genesis.txt` with their private keys. After that, the ceremony ends.

> **Note**
>
> You can shut the client down and start it up again if you need to. It will slow down the Tea Ceremony but will not disrupt it.

## After the successful ceremony

After the successful tea ceremony, the following files are created in the working directory:

- `genesis.txt` signed with the private keys of all the nodes in the chain,
- `node.config` containing the node private key.

After the Tea Ceremony ends successfully, you can start the node from the [Docker image](build-and-start-a-node/05-startingTpNode_docker.md) or [source code](build-and-start-a-node/06-startingTpNode_source.md) using our guides.
