# Tea Ceremony



## Introduction

**Tea Ceremony** is an algorithm for secure generation of [`genesis.txt`](../build-and-start-a-node/01-tpNodeConfiguration.md#generation-of-genesistxt) and [node private and public keys](../build-and-start-a-node/03-private-keys-generation.md). It allows nodes to exchange public keys without needing to exchange private keys with each other. Thanks to the Tea Ceremony algorithm, the node private keys are stored only on nodes they are generated for.

## Algorithm work scheme

Tea Ceremony algorithm works as follows:

1. Chain administrators initiate Tea Ceremony by addressing to the API using `curl`. Here is an example of initialization:

   ```bash
   curl -d '{"chain_number":666,"nodes":3,"settings":[{"p":["current","chain","blocktime"],"v":2},{"p":["current","chain","minsig"],"v":2},{"p":["current","chain","allowempty"],"v":0},{"p":["current","chain","patchsigs"],"v":2},{"p":["current","allocblock","block"],"v":666},{"p":["current","allocblock","group"],"v":10},{"p":["current","allocblock","last"],"v":0},{"p":["current","endless",["!bin","800140029A000001"],"SK"],"v":true},{"p":["current","endless",["!bin","800140029A000001"],"TST"],"v":true},{"p":["current","freegas"],"v":2000000},{"p":["current","something_left"],"v":["!bin","01020304"]},{"p":["current","gas","SK"],"v":1000},{"p":["current","nosk"],"v":1}]}' https://tea.thepower.io/api/new_ceremony -H "content-type: application/json"
   ```
   where

   - parameters in `""` are `json`-formatted;
   - `https://tea.thepower.io/api/new_ceremony` â€” API address for Tea Ceremony initialization.

2. The request returns a Ceremony token.
3. The user starts the Tea Ceremony client on their node. All node providers in the chain must start the Tea Ceremony client on their nodes to initiate generation of `genesis txt`. Otherwise, the node public keys will not be added into `genesis.txt` and will not be trusted.
4. The Tea Ceremony client [generates the keys](../build-and-start-a-node/03-private-keys-generation.md) for nodes.
5. The Tea Ceremony client waits for `genesis.txt` to sign it.
6. The Tea Ceremony client sends `genesis.txt` back to the chain.
7. The Tea Ceremony client creates the node configuration files.
